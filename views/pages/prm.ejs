                â€¢ Matlab project to naviagate a 6 armed robot through an obstacle filled environment to a desired end configuration. The
                Probabalistic Road Map method is used for configuration space graph construction. The created graph is then searched
                using Dijkstra's algorithm to create a route through which the robot can travel to reach it's end goal. The GUI and
                frame work was provided by the University of Pennsylvania's Computational Motion Planning online Mooc.
