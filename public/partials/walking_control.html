    <p>The objective of this project was to build a statically stable walking and turning interface for <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4603">JPL’s Robosimian quadrupedal robot</a> to allow operators to move the robot in real time. This was achieved by building a forward and sideways gaits, as well as a reset procedure. All the motions are statically stable. The software was built using  <a href="http://motion.pratt.duke.edu/klampt/">Klamp’t</a> for simulation, inverse kinematics, and physical modeling. The work was done under Kris Hausers’ <a href="http://motion.pratt.duke.edu/home.html">Intelligent Motion Laboratory</a> at Duke University. Supporting code is available upon request.</p>
